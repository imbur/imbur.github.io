I am a Software Engineer currently living in Zürich, Switzerland. I work for link:relational.ai[RelationalAI], and my job revolves around solving Knowledge Engineering challenges related to creating scalable enterprise-wide semantic layers. Between 2017 and 2021, I lived in Montréal, Canada, where I earned my PhD degree at McGill University's link:https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/[Electrical and Computer Engineering Department] under the supervision of link:https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/daniel-varro[Professor Dániel Varró]. The title of my thesis is link:http://imbur.github.io/phd/marton-bur-thesis.pdf[Query-Based Runtime Monitoring in Real-Time and Distributed Systems].

Before attending McGill University, I studied Software Engineering at Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME), Hungary, and I worked at link:https://inf.mit.bme.hu/en/[Fault Tolerant Systems Research Group (FTSRG)]. I earned my BSc and MSc degrees in Software Engineering in January 2014 and 2016, respectively, at BME's link:http://www.vik.bme.hu/en/[Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics].

== Research Interests

My main focus is on semantic layers and how they can be applied to the modern data stack:

 * Knowledge graphs for enterprise-wide semantic layers
 * Conceptual modeling
 * Adaptation of existing semantic standards for the modern data stack

Formerly I have worked in the following areas:

 * Model-based software engineering
 * Runtime monitoring of distributed cyber-physical systems
 * \Models@run.time for IoT and cyber-physical systems
 * Local search-based graph pattern matching
