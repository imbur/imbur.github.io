I am a Software Engineer by education and I am currently working for link:https://relational.ai[RelationalAI] as a _Knowledge Engineer_. I earned my PhD degree at McGill University's link:https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/[Electrical and Computer Engineering Department] under the supervision of link:https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/daniel-varro[Professor Dániel Varró]. The title of my thesis is link:http://imbur.github.io/phd/marton-bur-thesis.pdf[Query-Based Runtime Monitoring in Real-Time and Distributed Systems].

Before attending McGill University, I pursued PhD studies in Software Engineering at BME and I worked at the link:https://inf.mit.bme.hu/en/[Fault Tolerant Systems Research Group]. I earned my MSc degree in Software Engineering in January 2016 at the link:http://www.vik.bme.hu/en/[Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics], Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME).. I received my BSc degree in Computer Engineering in January 2014 at BME.
