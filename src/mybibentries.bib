	abstract = {Graph database systems are increasingly adapted for storing and processing heterogeneous network-like datasets. Many challenging applications with near real-time requirements—such as financial fraud detection, on-the-fly model validation and root cause analysis—can be formalised as graph problems and tackled with graph databases efficiently. However, as no standard graph query language has yet emerged, users are subjected to the possibility of vendor lock-in. The openCypher group aims to define an open specification for a declarative graph query language. However, creating an openCypher-compatible query engine requires significant research and engineering efforts. Meanwhile, model-driven language workbenches support the creation of domain-specific languages by providing high-level tools to create parsers, editors and compilers. In this paper, we present an approach to build a compiler and optimizer for openCypher using model-driven technologies, which allows developers to define declarative optimization rules. {\textcopyright} 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Association for Computing Machinery. Model-based systems engineering of critical cyber-physical systems necessitates effective collaboration between different stakeholders while still providing secure protection of intellectual properties of all involved parties. While engineering artifacts are frequently stored in version control repositories, secure access control is limited to file-level strategies in most existing frameworks where models are split into multiple fragments with all-or-nothing permissions, which becomes a scalability and usability bottleneck in case of complex industrial models. In this paper, we introduce the MONDO Collaboration Framework, which provides rule-based fine-grained model-level secure access control, property-based locking and automated model merge integrated over existing version control systems such as Subversion (SVN) for storage and version control. Our framework simultaneously supports offline collaboration (asynchronous checkoutmodify- commit) on top of off-the-shelf modeling tools and online scenarios (GoogleDocs-style short transactions) scenarios by offering a web-based modeling frontend.

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.Model-driven engineering (MDE) is becoming a key approach in systems engineering, including Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) design. It relies on systematic use of models from an early phase of the design process to provide source code generation, validation and analysis support. However, due to the complexity of IMA systems - that may incorporate hundreds of avionics functions and dozens of execution nodes - even early stage model-based analysis of their design can become cumbersome. This is especially true for safety related nonfunctional requirements like communication channel redundancy or error propagation and contamination. In this paper, we present a model-driven framework to support the iterative design and analysis of IMA systems using an integrated Simulink model for analyzing the complete HW-SW architecture of the system.},
