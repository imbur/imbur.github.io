I am currently a PhD student in Software Engineering at McGill University under the supervision of [Dániel Varró](https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/daniel-varro).

I earned my MSc degree in Computer Engineering in January 2016 at Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME). Before coming to McGill University, [I pursued PhD studies](https://inf.mit.bme.hu/en/members/burm) in Software Engineering at BME and I worked at the [Fault Tolerant Systems Research Group](https://inf.mit.bme.hu/en/). I received my BSc degree in Computer Engineering in January 2014 at BME.
